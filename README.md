# dotfiles-pi400
This is a repository for my dotfiles for i3 running on Manjaro, on my Raspberry Pi 400

Nothing fancy here ;)

My dotfiles are all located in ~/gitRepos/dotfiles/ and then a directory for each thing. Then are then symlinked to my ~/.config folder. This is inspired by the way The Linux Cast youtube channel does his dotfiles.
